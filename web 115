<h1>Morris Colato-WEB-115-N801</h1>
<p>I Morris Colato, agree to abide by the terms in my Fall 2021, WEB-115-N801 with my instructor,
Professor D.I. von Briesen. I understand that all work that I do on my school and personal websites
will be publicly available to the world. I will not put information there that is inappropriate for
schoolwork, or that I wish to keep private. I also understand that it is my work that counts for
attendance, not logins or showing up for class. As such, failure to turn in assignments may show as
an absences.</p>
